* a prolog
  * and I should implement a solver for a type constraint system with it
* a smalltalk
  * not strictly necessary, but I really ought to know...
  * and of course it should have reflection
* a forth from scratch, but actually *finish* it
* refinement types!


of course, this isn't counting all of the:
* parsing algorithms
* compilers
  * optimizations
* virtual machines
* compilation targets
* features like IDEs, language servers, syntax highlighters, debuggers, fuck fuck fuck
